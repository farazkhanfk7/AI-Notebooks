# Classification Algorithms
These are some classification algorithms I'll be working on.

## K-nearest Neighbours
K-Nearest Neighbors is an algorithm for supervised learning. Where the data is 'trained' with data points corresponding to their classification. Once a point is to be predicted, it takes into account the 'K' nearest points to it to determine it's classification.
